# <div align="left"><img src="https://rapids.ai/assets/images/rapids_logo.png" width="90px"/>&nbsp; [RAPIDS.ai](www.rapids.ai.com) Website

Code and content for the [RAPIDS.ai](www.rapids.ai.com) static public website. This is a refactor from the previous Jekyll backed version. It uses the [Apline.js](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) frameworks. No builds or npm installations are necessary.


## Design and Layout
Use the [RAPIDS Brand Guide](brand.html) and the [Template Design Guide](template.html) for reference while updating and creating new pages.
Refer to the [Bulma Documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) for reference to the CSS class names and components. 
Each page must include the standardized [Header Section](header.html) and [Footer Section](footer.html), which is dynamically included by Apline.js. 
All logos and images are located in the [images](/images) folder. Externally referenced files can be found in the [files](/files).
Font Icons are used from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).


## Deployment and Contributions
Hosting is currently done through static html on [GitHub](github.com), using the root `master` branch. To contribute, [fork the repository](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids.ai/fork) and create a (Pull Request)[https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids.ai/pulls] with the changes.


## Release Checklist

- Home page release dates and versions
